# STAT 159 - Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science

- __Descrtipion__: This course teaches "the why and how" of reproducible and collaborative research by combining questions of good computational practice in science, open science and statistical data analysis, in the context of today's research environment. We will interleave practical topics in software engineering and statistical computing with broader discussions on elements of reproducible data analysis.

- __Details__: We will rely on R and RStudio ecosystems, but the core ideas presented here can be equally implemented with tools in Python, Julia, or any other programming language.

- __Instructor__: [Gaston Sanchez](https://www.gastonsanchez.com)

- __Lecture__: 3 hours of lecture per week

- __Assignments__: around 6 HW assignments

- __Exams__: typically one midterm exam, and final project

- __Prerequisites__: Statistics 133, 134, 135

	- https://git-scm.com/downloads

- __GitHub__ (Git repository hosting service)
	- https://github.com/
  - Open account (if you don't have one): https://github.com/join

- __R__ (statistical & data analysis software)
	- Mac OS X: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
	- Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
	- Linux: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/

- __Posit RStudio__ (IDE for R)
	- Desktop (free) version: https://posit.co/downloads/

- __Rtools__ (tools for building R in Windows)

## 1. Introduction

:card_index: __ABOUT__:

We begin with the usual review of the course policies, logistics, overall expectations, topics in a nutshell, etc.

Every Data Analysis Project goes through a cycle: At the conceptual level, we'll identify the main stages of the data analysis cycle using sports data _Long Jump world records_ which are one of the oldest standing records in athletics.
