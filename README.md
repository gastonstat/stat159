# STAT 159 - Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science

- __Descrtipion__: This course teaches "the why and how" of reproducible and collaborative research by combining questions of good computational practice in science, open science and statistical data analysis, in the context of today's research environment. We will interleave practical topics in software engineering and statistical computing with broader discussions on elements of reproducible data analysis.

- __Details__: We will rely on R and RStudio ecosystems, but the core ideas presented here can be equally implemented with tools in Python, Julia, or any other programming language.
